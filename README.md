## Introduction
Hello! My name is Mohamed Hassan, and I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree in the Robotics Department at The American University in Cairo. I have a deep interest in low-level software development, electronics, and all things related to embedded systems.

My journey into the world of embedded systems was a revelation. I felt like I had finally discovered my true passion. Recently, I’ve also developed a keen interest in contributing to open-source projects. The idea of a community of developers from around the world collaborating on a single project really fascinated me. As a beginner, I’ve been actively searching for opportunities to make meaningful contributions.

Coincidentally, I stumbled upon Google Summer of Code (GSoC) without any prior knowledge. I searched for the participatig organization. And I found [Real-time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS)]([url](https://www.rtems.org/)) is participating. So without much thinking I engaged with the RTEMS community in order to contribute for their awesome project.

The good news is I have been accepted into GSoC 2024 with RTEMS. Which is a great apportuinity. RTEMS is an open-source real-time operating system that is widely used in many safety-cirtical application especially in the space industry. Actually RTEMS has orbited Venus, Mars and even the Sun.


My project [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kn02yQQNI9qHwup5kuGEhj-9l-dpnwYgYvFceXD-BxA/edit#heading=h.f0qomue69e9r) that has been accepted is about making the stack checker reporter configurable. Since the begging of RTEMS, the stack checker is initialized. If a stack overflow occured it prints out the information of the the task that caused the overflow, the shut down the system. This project aimes to give the user the flexibility to configure what happens in case of a stack overflow is detected.
