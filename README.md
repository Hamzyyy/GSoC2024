## Introduction
Hello! My name is Mohamed Hassan, and I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree in the Robotics Department at The American University in Cairo. I have a deep interest in low-level software development, electronics, and all things related to embedded systems.

My journey into the world of embedded systems programming was a revelation I felt like I had finally discovered my true passion. Recently, I’ve also developed a keen interest in contributing to open-source projects. The idea of a community of developers from around the world can collaborate on a single project really fascinated me. As a beginner, I’ve been actively searching for opportunities to make meaningful contributions.

Coincidentally, I stumbled upon Google Summer of Code (GSoC) without any prior knowledge. I searched for the participatig organization that are related to embedded system. And I found [Real-time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS)]([url](https://www.rtems.org/)) is participating.

The good news is I have been accepted into GSoC 2024 with RTEMS. Which is really a great apportuinity. RTEMS is an open-source real-time operating system that is widely used in many safety-cirtical application especially in the space industry.
