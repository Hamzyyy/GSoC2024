## Introduction
Hello! I'm Mohamed Hassan, currently pursuing a master’s degree in Robotics at The American University in Cairo. My passion lies in low-level software development, electronics, and embedded systems.

My journey into embedded systems felt like discovering my true calling. Recently, I’ve become fascinated by contributing to open-source projects, inspired by the idea of global collaboration.

I stumbled upon Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and found [RTEMS](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/rtems-project)(Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) participating. Without hesitation, I wanted to join the RTEMS community to contribute to their awesome project.

I'm thrilled to share that I've been accepted into GSoC 2024 with RTEMS, an open-source real-time operating system used in critical applications, especially in the space industry—RTEMS has even orbited Venus, Mars, and the Sun!

My accepted [project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kn02yQQNI9qHwup5kuGEhj-9l-dpnwYgYvFceXD-BxA/edit#heading=h.f0qomue69e9r) focuses on making the stack checker reporter configurable. Traditionally, RTEMS’ stack checker is initialized automatically with each task, and if a stack overflow occurs, it logs the task information and shuts down the system. My project aims to give users the flexibility to configure the response when a stack overflow is detected.

## Community Bonding
During the community bonding period, I started to engage with RTEMS community. I tried first to understand the code of the rtems stack check. I made a mind map of all functions and utilities provided by the stack checker.
